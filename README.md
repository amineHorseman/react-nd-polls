# React Polls Project

A web app that lets users create and answer polls. Built with React, Redux Toolkit, and Bootstrap.

# Context 

This is the assessment project for Udacity's React Redux course.

The goal is to create a polls app allowing users to create and answer polls. Users can login, answer polls, create new polls, and see their ranking in the leaderboard.

For the moment, the project is focusing on the frontend only. The data is retrieved through a simple API file provided by Udacity. In the future, I will add a backend that will be shared in another repository.
